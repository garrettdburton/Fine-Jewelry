SW-1,SW1,"A necklace of ninety-two lapis lazuli beads, seventeen of which are double drilled. There are fifteen double drilled pendant beads of elongated form at the enter of the necklace.  These bulge at the center and taper to points at the bottom.  They graduate in size from the middle to the back on either side.  The center bead is 3 cm in height,  8 cm in width, and 1.05 cm in thickness at the center. The drill holes are 8.5 mm apart and have diameters of 2 mm.  The smallest is 1.65 cm in height, 5.3 mm in width and 6.5 mm in thickness.  There are very faint remnants of the horizontal grooves that are typical at the top and bottom ends of these pendant beads; they have been mostly worn off through use. They are strung on a double strand of barrel beads.  The barrel beads are 1.1 cm -1.3 cm in length, 5 mm in width with drill holes 2mm in diameter. They graduate slightly to lengths of 6 mm, and widths of 4 mm.   There is a pair of rectangular double drilled pieces that are used as spacers for the two strands on either side of the necklace.  They are 2 cm wide and 1.5 cm in length with a thickness of 8 mm.  The diameters of the drill holes are 2.5 mm. One piece has diagonal grooves on one side extending towards the center from each corner.  The other is not grooved.
        There have been a number of suggestions as to what these forms represent.  We favor the idea that these are representations of silk worms. There are jade versions of larval forms found in tombs in China from the Warring States Period. We think that these may be the prototypes for these lapis lazuli beads.  The time period is about the same – roughly 500 B.C. to 500 A.D. These beads come from the Swat Valley in what is now northern Pakistan.","$1,000.00","Lapis Lazuli, Silver",,"The necklace is 18 inches (45.6 cm) in length.

M-18,M18,"A necklace of thirty-three diamond shaped double-drilled lapis lazuli beads each of which is separated by two groups of four small carnelian beads with a lapis lazuli bead in the center.  The diamond shaped lapis beads graduate slightly in size towards the back of the necklace.   The middle bead is also notched at the center. It is 1.35 cm in height, 7 mm wide and 3.5 mm in thickness.  The drill hole diameter is 1.5 mm.  The diamond shaped bead to the right is 1.5 cm in height, 8 mm in width, and 3.4 mm in thickness.  The smallest is 7 mm in height, 5 mm in width, and 3 mm in thickness.  The disc beads are 3 mm in height and 2 mm in length.  The round lapis beads used in the bottom row are 3.4 mm – 3.0 mm in diameter. 
     The use of slightly larger lapis lazuli beads in the center of the five bead groups in the bottom row causes the necklace to curve allowing the necklace to function as a curved strap.  We have utilized this to make a choker length necklace.  Although the diamond shaped double drilled beads could be strung in any number of ways in designing a necklace, it is very tempting to think that this is the intended use for this type of bead.  The success of a design such as this depends very much on precise spacing of the elements.  Slight irregularities in the sizes of the diamond shaped beads complicate the problem as does lack of uniformity in the spacing between the two holes.  These challenges can only be overcome by trial and error.  

There are 272 small carnelian disc beads, 70 small lapis lazuli beads and 33 diamond shaped lapis lazuli double drilled beads. The beading tips and hook and eye clasp are 20k gold.","$2,450.00","Lapis Lazuli, 20k gold",,"The necklace is 16 inches (40.06 cm) in length.

M-20,M20,"A necklace of thirty-four carnelian and eighteen lapis lazuli beads.  Fifteen of the carnelian beads are long tapered cylinder beads and twelve are shorter bi-conical beads, seven of which have a distinct line around the circumference in the middle where  the two planes intersect, the remaining six are of a more rounded form. The center bead is 3.23 cm in length, 1.33 cm in thickness at the center and 6.8 mm wide at the ends. The drill hole diameter is 1.5 mm. There is some evidence of regrinding in an attempt to polish out three slight chips in the surface, but apparently the attempt was abandoned leaving very slight facets over these chips.  The bead is handsomely banded with layers of both clear and white quartz. The next white and orange bead back on the left side of the photograph is 2.05 cm in length, 9.3 mm thick at the center and 5.9 mm wide at the ends. The hole diameter is 1.5 mm.  The next tapered cylinder bead to the back is a mixture of lighter and darker orange and is 1.79 cm in length, 8.5 mm at the center and 5.2 mm at the ends. The hole diameter is 1.8 mm.  The next white and orange tapered cylinder bead to the back (left side of the photograph) is 2.05 cm in length, 9 mm wide at the widest point in the center, and 4.8 mm wide at the ends.  The drill hole diameter is 1.2mm.  This bead has also been reground on opposing sides to remove chipped out areas making it about 1.6 mm narrower.  The next long tapered carnelian bead is a mixture of lighter and darker orange and is 1.72 cm in length, 8 mm wide at the center and 4 mm thick at the ends. The drill hole diameter is 1.4 mm.  The next white and orange bead back is 1.72 cm in length, 8 mm wide at the center and 5.5 mm wide at the ends. The drill hole diameter is 2.5 mm.  The less tapered ends and the wide drill hole indicate that this bead is considerably older than the previous beads listed, probably around four thousand years old. The previous beads are from around two thousand years ago.  The whitened bead at the back is also a four thousand year old bead with the large hole and distinct line at the circumference. It is 1.4 cm in length, 6.2 mm at the circumference and 4.2 mm wide at the ends.  The drill hole diameter is 2.4 mm.  The bead has been whitened by burial in alkaline soil. It has the distinct profile of a bead from the Indus civilization.   
    We will now list the beads going from back to front, on the right side of the photograph: The bead pictured above is also an Indus agate bead that has been whitened by burial in alkaline soil. It is 1.8 cmin length, 6 mm at the widest point in the center, and 4.5 mm wide at the ends.  The diameter of the drill hole is 3 mm.  In the center of the next group of three carnelian beads to the front is a rounded barrel bead with tapered ends 1.25 cm in length.  It is 7.6 mm at the widest point and 4 mm wide at the ends. The drill hole diameter is 1.5 mm.  There is some chipping at one end and in the body of the bead. The next white bead forward is very similar to the other orange and white striped beads previously described, except it has been whitened by burial in alkaline soil resulting in the white being  opaque instead if semi translucent. It is 1.9 cm in length, 8.9 mm at the center and 5.8 mm at the ends. The hole diameter is 1.2 mm.  The longer carnelian bead in the next group of three beads forward is 2.03 cm in length, 8 mm wide at the center and 4 mm wide at the ends.  The drill hole diameter is 2 mm. The next carnelian bead forward is a dark orange with translucent white banding. It is 2.3 c m in length, 8.5 mm wide at the center and 5 mm wide at the ends.  The drill hole diameter is 1.5 mm.  The longer carnelian bead in the next group of three forward is 1.8 cm in length, 8.5 mm at the center and 5 mm at the ends. The drill hole diameter is 2 mm. The last white and pale orange striped bead, to the right of the center bead in the photograph is 2.05 cm in length, 9.5mm at the center and 5 mm at the ends. The drill hgole diameter is 2mm.  The carnelian bi-cone beads range in size: the largest is 1.22cm in length, 1 cm at the center and 6 mm at the ends, with the drill hole diameter at 2.5 mm.  The smallest  is 9 mm in length, 8.2 mm at the center and 5.2 mm at the ends.  The drill hole diameter is 2.5 mm.  There are a number of smaller tapered barrel beds of squat proportion and less distinct form that are used as spacers in the groups of three carnelians towards the back of the necklace.  The principle beads with banding are faced with lapis lazuli beads. The largest is 5.5 mm in length and 9 mm in circumference. The smallest are 4 mm in length and 8 mm wide.  These are short cylinder forms with rounded edges.  There are pairs of lapis disc beads 4 mm by 2mm that face the Indus beads at the back. There is a garnet bead at the very back of the necklace ( third from left in the above photograph) 6mm in size.

SW-13a,SW13a,"A necklace of twenty-five double drilled lapis lazuli beads strung on a double strand of one hundred thirty-two cylindrical carnelian beads with clear and white quartz banding. The sixty-six beads in the top strand are slightly smaller than the sixty-six in the bottom strand which gives the curve to the strand that allows it to fit properly on the wearer's body. The carnelian cylinder beads range in size:  The largest is 6 mm in length and 4.2 mm wide. The smallest is 4.5 mm in length and 2.3 mm wide.  The diameters of the drill holes are 2 mm to 1.2 mm. The lapis pieces graduate in size towards the back of the necklace. The center bead is 3.2 cm in height.  It is 6 mm wide at the center and 8.8 mm thick at the thickest point just above the center.  The smallest is 1.45 cm in height and 5.3 mm wide.  It is 6 mm thick at the center. The diameters of the drill holes are 2 mm.  There are variations in the forms but all follow the same basic schema: An elongated form is drilled through the side at the middle or just above the middle.  A second hole is drilled through the side near the top.  The bottom half tapers to a narrower point than the top half. The form is flat on the back and bulges outward at the middle.  A series of grooves is cut across the form at the top end and the bottom end. These can be as few as two grooves across the top and three across the bottom to five across the top and seven across the bottom. The idea seems to be to fill the space rather than to have a specific number of grooves. Some of the pieces lack the groves entirely, or have faint traces, probably due to wear. 
       There have been a number of suggestions as to what these forms represent.  We favor the idea that these are representations of silk worms. There are jade versions of larval forms found in tombs in China from the Warring States Period and Western Zhou. We think that these may be the prototypes for these lapis lazuli beads.

    Most of the largest pendants do not have perfectly round concavities on the front side, although nine of the smaller ones do. The larger ones have longer heights than widths and they tend to taper inwards towards the top, with the sides not being parallel to one another, giving more the impression of a scoop than a spoon. The larger pendants have a more shallow concavity than the smaller ones. Perhaps this is the result of using a large bit in a bow drill to form the concavities in the smaller spoons, and not using this technique in the fashioning of the larger spoons. In any case, there are some variations in the forms of the spoons. The use of the spoon form dates from the Bronze Age and continues for some time, perhaps even for several thousand years. They are found in present-day Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. The exact symbolism of the spoon form is unknown, but may pertain to the idea of abundance and plenty.","$3,000.00","Lapis Lazuli, 20k gold",,"The necklace is 17 ¾ inches ( 45.3 cm) in length.

     The Tri-ratna ( “three jewels”) pendant is considered to be a Buddhist symbol and was probably used as such two thousand years ago when these beads were made. It is often seen on ancient coins and on pillars and gateways in association with two other symbols that have been linked to Buddhism, the  Wheel of the Law,( a wheel with eight spokes), and the Svastika. The Svastika and the Tri-ratna are very ancient symbols that can be found on coins from Taxila, from the Harappan civilization dating to four thousand years ago. As this predates Buddhism, it seems that the symbols were appropriated as they were already in long use and considered to be sacred.  The designation “Tri-ratna” is itself a modern appellation. Western scholars in the eighteenth century associated the three pronged shape with the three jewels, the objects of refuge, the Buddha, Dharma, and the Sangha.

    There is some similarity in form to frog effigy amulets from the earliest period. The use of the frog as a symbolic amulet of fertility has occurred in many early cultures in both hemispheres, including Egypt and South American cultures. The sudden appearance of many frogs arising from the waters in the spring is a herald of fertility. The transformation of the frog from the aquatic tadpole to the air breathing land animal that can swim is also symbolic of magical transformation. It is interesting to speculate that the Tri-ratna symbol may have started out as a frog.","$2,700.00","Carnelian, Lapis Lazuli, Turquoise, 20k gold",,"The necklace is 19 3/8 inches (49.3 cm) in length.

The two stands are joined with a lapis lazuli bead at the very back and thread into silver beading tips to which the hook and eye clasp are attached.  
The lapis pieces graduate in size towards the back of the necklace. The center bead is 2.45 cm in height.  It is 6 mm wide at the center and 9.0 mm thick at the thickest point just above the center.  The smallest is 1.22 cm in height and 5.0 mm wide.  It is 6 mm thick at the center. The diameters of the drill holes are 2 mm.  There are variations in the forms but all follow the same basic schema: An elongated form is drilled through the side at the middle or just above the middle.  A second hole is drilled through the side near the top.  The bottom half tapers to a narrower point than the top half. The form is flat on the back and bulges outward at the middle.  A series of grooves is cut across the form at the top end and the bottom end. These can be as few as two grooves across the top and three across the bottom to five across the top and seven across the bottom. The idea seems to be to fill the space rather than to have a specific number of grooves.  
       There have been a number of suggestions as to what these forms represent.  We favor the idea that these are representations of silk worms. There are jade versions of larval forms found in tombs in China from the Warring States Period and Western Zhou. We think that these may be the prototypes for these lapis lazuli beads.  The time period is about the same – roughly 500 B.C. to 500 A.D. These beads come from the Swat Valley in what is now northern Pakistan, between the Indus River and the Karakoram Mountain range to the north. The clasp and beading tips are sterling silver.

SW-14,SW14,"A necklace of thirty-seven rock crystal beads and thirty-eight lapis lazuli beads of various shapes.  The rock crystal beads include ten pendant beads of tear-drop shape. They are narrow when seen from the front and wider in side view. Several of them have one wide side which is flatter than the other, probably a consequence of the method of shaping. They are roughly shaped and then tumble polished to round all of the edges.  The largest of these is 1.65 cm in height, 1.4 cm in width at the widest point and 6 cm in thickness at the bottom tapering to 3 mm in thickness at the drill hole.  The drill hole diameter is 2 mm.  Most of these are about 1.5 cm in height 1.1cm – 1.2 cm in width, and 6mm - 8mm in thickness.  The beads range in size from 1.5 cm to 8 mm in length.  There are many variations in shape: round and flattened spheres, short bi-cones with six sides, barrel shapes and faceted barrel shapes.  The smaller beads towards the back of the necklace are the more precisely cut, with the facets of equal size. One such example is 8.5 mm in length, 9 mm in width and with a drill hole diameter of 1.2 mm. There are eight planes arranged equally around the drill hole and then a second register of sixteen triangles around the circumference at he equator. There are four such beads in the necklace. There are three more of this level of craftsmanship, but of a different design, being short bicones with eight facets around each hemisphere. The largest one is 1 cm in length, 1.4 cm in width at the center and with a drill hole diameter of 1.5 mm.   The larger beads give the impression of being roughly shaped and then wheel cut with flat planes and facets, with no attempt at overall symmetry.  The lapis beads are similarly rough in shape, being short barrels and flattened spheres. The center bead is angled slightly on the sides being 1.3 cm in length at the bottom and 1.05 cm in length at the top. The width is 1.25 on one end and 7 mm on the other. The drill hole diameter is 3 mm. Once again, the impression is that the makers were making as little alteration to the pieces as possible in order to maximize the size of the beads. The beads graduate in size from the from of the necklace to the back , from around 1 cm to 5 mm in length, and 1 .25 cm to 7.5 mm in width.  These seem to be made for the common people rather than for the sophisticated elite.

Each stone bead is separated by a granulated 22k gold ring bead, fifty-four in all. The beading tips and hook and eye clasp are also 22k gold. 
   The center bead is a tabular etched carnelian 1.7 cm in width, 6.2mm in thickness at the center and tapering to 3.6mm thickness at the edge. The drill hole is 2.5mm in diameter. The carnelian is translucent so that when held up to the light it can be sen that he drill hole is one continuous drilling, and not two holes drilled from each end that meet in the center of the bead. This also reveals some internal cracks; the larger one emerges on the back of the bead but does not extend to the front.  These appear to be caused by the heat treating that is part of the process of “etching” the white line into the face of the bead.  This is done by applying a strong alkaline substance (such as natron ) mixed with a vegetable gum extracted from plants and then heating the bead until the applied design fuses with the stone matrix of the bead. This process was perfected by the Harrapan civilization over four thousand years ago. There was a second period of production two thousand years ago and later during the Sassanian period in Persia after 525 A.D.  This single circle, “eye” bead is typical of the earliest period.  The two lozenge shaped tabular carnelian beads are likewise etched with an infinity or “eyeglass” pattern on both sides.

There are also four carnelian beads with four trapezoidal sides. A pair of lapis lazuli drop pendants terminate the two free hanging strands that extend downward from the body of the carnelian turtle that is the focus of the necklace. The turtle is rendered in an abstracted form. The tabular body with a head extending from one end, is flat on the back side; the sides are notched with a single groove to indicate legs and the head is likewise delineated by rounding both the “shell” and the head which is distinguished from the body by grinding inwards to form a neck.  A small groove on the top of the head (parallel to the length of the body) is the basis for rounding the protuberances to form the eyes.  A groove across the front of the head indicates a mouth. The economy of means used to suggest the parts of the turtle recalls the strategies of abstraction employed by recent modernist art; however this piece is probably about two thousand years old. The turtle is 1.5cm from nose to tail.  The bead is 1.1cm in width and 5cm in thickness.  The parallel drill holes emerge from two notches at the back of the shell (which suggest a tail) and at the shoulders on either side of the head on the front side.

We know that insects were used for symbolic expression in ancient Egypt: the dung beetle rolling its sphere of dung in front of it was associated with the power that caused the sun to move across the sky.

The beading tips and hook and eye clasp are fine silver. 
      The agate frog amulet is 1.3 cm in length, 8.5mm in height and 1.05 cm in width. The drill hole emerges at the back between the two legs and at the front from under the chin.  The diameter of the drill hole is 2mm. The agate material has been whitened from chemical interaction with alkaline soil.  The carving is precise and expressive. The two eyes bulge outward on the top of the head and are partially undercut by a groove which gives the impression that the frog has a fierce expression.  This is augmented by the wide mouth with a sight downturn at each side. The chin protrudes beneath the groove that indicates the mouth which further confirms the frog's belligerent nature. This is an intimidating bullfrog despite the miniature size of the amulet. 
     The life cycle of the frog is a story of transformation, with the tadpole swimming in the water and then changing form to emerge onto the land. The tadpoles seem to appear overnight in great numbers as if from nowhere. Then they mysteriously transform into frogs. These symbolic associations of the frog made it a talisman of abundance, bounty and magical transformation. Frogs appear suddenly following the first rains of spring in great numbers and are therefore harbingers of growth and fertility. The transformational nature of their life cycle, from egg to tadpole to frog is also notable. They begin life in the water, later transitioning to land, all of which is symbolically important. Humans also make this transition at birth leaving the watery world of the womb and being born onto the land. This association accounts for the linking of the symbol of the frog to the uterus. There is a structure to the arrangement of the beads, a bilateral symmetry of sorts, but the appearance is one of randomness. It is very likely that the use of beads in necklaces in the ancient world was a lot like the use in this necklace, more random than structured. We in the modern world place primary importance on the look of the jewelry, and so we favor structure and symmetry in both form and color. In the ancient world the primary purpose was amuletic and protective. Beads were a way to insure, by means of their magical properties, that inimical forces would be neutralized and kept at bay. Of course, the beads would grab the attention, ward off the evil eye, and channel the protective powers of the earth. Even the sound of beads clicking and clacking together would offer protective help and security in living in an uncertain world.","$2,500.00","Lapis Lazuli, Carnelian, Agate, Turquoise, Silver",,"The necklace is 23 5/8 inches (60.3cm) in length.

The stone beads are made such that the beads have two zones, one of milky quartz and one of clear quartz or rock crystal. The beads have been shaped so that the dividing line between the two zones is the widest point in the width of the tapered cylinders. This is usually at the approximate center of the bead, but not always as can be seen in the center bead in the necklace. It seems as if it is more important that the widest point be at the dividing line between the two zones than that the bead be symmetrical with the widest point being in the center regardless of where the color change occurs. That this was done intentionally implies a symbolic meaning for this choice which is now lost in the mists of time.

     We like to design necklaces with repeating modules of matched sets of colors and shapes and with geometric compositions. However, in the ancient world, having the luxury of designing such highly structured necklaces was probably restricted by economics and the availability of special materials to only the very highest levels of society. The necklaces of beads worn by most people were probably somewhat random arrangements of miscellaneous sizes shapes and materials. The aesthetics of these arrangements took a back seat to the protective power that wearing the beads afforded. This necklace is more in line with what would have been worn by most people in ancient times.

The sizes of these beads graduate towards the back of the necklace. At the center the lapis beads are 5 mm in width. At the back they are 3.5 mm in width. The longer beads are 7.5 mm in length and the short are 4 mm. These reduce to 6 mm in length  and 3 mm in length at the back. The diameters of the drill holes are 2mm.  The tabular carnelian beads are 1 cm in diameter at the front of the necklaced and 7.5 mm in diameter at the back. They are 3.5 mm – 4.0 mm in thickness. The diameters of the drill holes are 2 mm.
     The whitening of some of the carnelian tabular beads is the result of chemical interaction with alkaline soil; the consequence of being buried for centuries in the ground.  The beads are from the Swat Valley of what is now northern Pakistan. Two thousand years ago, when these beads were made and being worn, it was a Buddhist kingdom known as Uddiyana (“The Garden”).","$2,100.00","Lapis Lazuli, Carnelian, Silver",,"The necklace is 17 ½ inches (45 cm) in length.

      The carnelian beads graduate in size towards the back of the necklace. The largest beads are 6 mm in length, 4.5 mm in width and have drill holes of 1.5 mm. The smallest carnelian beads at the back are 4.5 mm in length and 3.2 mm in width. The lapis lazuli pendant beads are around 1 cm in height at the center and decrease to around 7 mm at the back. They are of various forms: at the back are eight spoon shaped pendants, there are four ax forms and four pointed forms that could be spear points, and four tear drop or inverted cone shapes. There is one pendant that is only 3.5 mm in width but has a thickness of 6.8 mm in contrast to the others which tend to be wider and not as thick as they are wide. This pendant has a notch filed in the bottom resulting in two asymmetrical lobes. Although the reference is not immediately clear to us, it would have been obvious to the people for whom it was made. There is a some slight damage to three of the pendants: two of the spoons have nicks in their edges and one of the diamond shaped pieces (spear point?) has its bottom point broken off. The pendants appear to be in the forms of protective amulets with symbolic meanings. The spears drive away evil, the axes are associated with a Mother Goddess, the spoons are used to make offerings, and so forth. The beads come from the Swat Valley in what is now northern Pakistan. Two thousand years ago it was a Buddhist kingdom known as Uddiyana. It included parts of what is now Afghanistan which is certainly where the lapis lazuli used in the pendants originated. Uddiyana was of considerable strategic and commercial importance in the ancient world. Its fertile valleys, warm climate, and above all, its central position on the busy trade routes between Asia and the Mediterranean made it valuable territory to control. As a consequence, it suffered numerous conquests, with each conqueror leaving an imprint on the culture; the result was a cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic society which is reflected in the many types and materials of the beads that are found there. The combination of lapis lazuli and carnelian was especially prized in ancient Mesopotamia. Beads were traded throughout the ancient world and many traditional cultures still wear beads, often having specific ensembles that are a marker of cultural identity. Beads were also a magical means of protection and the wearing of amulets was prevalent in all levels of society. Beads were not just a means of decoration, but were an important component in the spiritual connection to the gods and nature.","$2,350.00","Carnelian, Lapis Lazuli, 20k gold",,"The necklace is 16 inches (41 cm) in length.

The central pendant is 3.6 cm in width, 3.35 cm in height and 6.5 mm in thickness. The shell is slightly convex being 4.5 mm in actual thickness at the top and 3 mm in thickness at the bottom. The flat double drilled beads are 7 mm in length,1 cm in height, and 3 mm in thickness. The round beads are 6 mm in diameter.

The double drilled beads and the small tooth pendants are Bronze Age and this dates to 2,000 B.C.E. making them four thousand years old. The turquoise beads are probably from this period as well. The round beads may well be Bronze Age but since round beads were made in all periods, there is nothing distinctive to use for dating purposes. We must rely on the context, and these beads did all come from the same source. The shell pendant at the center is certainly very old but probably not as old as the other beads. This design is not found with Bronze Age beads and is consistent with medieval Islamic designs. The type of shell used is found in headpieces from Afghanistan that are said to be Kazak.

SW-81,SW81,"A necklace of sixty-one stone beads of various sizes, shapes and materials: agate, chalcedony, lapis lazuli and carnelian, some of which have been artificially patterned or “etched.” There are barrel shaped beads, tabular and spherical ones as well as some with irregular shapes. The tabular agate bead in the center of the necklace is 1.7 cm in diameter and 7.3 mm in thickness. The diameter of the drill hole is 2 mm. To either side of the center bead are two round carnelian beads 7 mm in diameter and then two barrel shaped carnelian beads that have been artificially patterned. They are around 1.5 cm in length and 8 mm in width at the center. Although they are known as “etched” carnelians, this is a misnomer that resulted from a misunderstanding of the patterning process. This is done by applying a strong alkaline substance (such as natron) mixed with a vegetable gum extracted from plants and then heating the bead until the applied design fuses with the stone matrix of the bead. This process was perfected by the Harrapan civilization over four thousand years ago. There was a second period of production two thousand years ago and third later during the Sassanian period in Persia after 525 A.D.
These seem to be from the middle period. The barrel bead that is a dirty white with black lines and a zigzag in the middle is the result of chemical interaction with alkaline soil. It would have originally been orange with white lines. After the small lapis lazuli spacer beads are two tabular artificially patterned carnelian beads 1.4 cm in diameter and 5 mm-6mm in thickness. The one to the left in the photograph has four triangles positioned to make a cross in the negative space between the triangles. It is probably from the middle period or about two thousand years old. On the other side is a tabular carnelian bead with six diamond shapes that all point towards the center forming a six pointed star. Although the pattern is found in middle period beads, there are reasons to believe it is from the late period (or no older than 1,500 years). The bead is slightly thicker and has a flat edge instead of the tapered edge; on this flat edge a white line has been applied. The drawing of the six pointed star is slightly irregular and tentative as opposed to the designs from the middle period. The barrel shaped carnelian beads, (1 cm – 1.2 cm in length, 8 mm in width, drill hole diameter 2 mm), each have four white lines that form longitudinal stripes. These are also middle period types. The necklace continues with tabular beads separated with smaller spacer beads and an occasional barrel bead. “Etched” carnelian beads should probably be referred to as “artificially patterned.” The bead to the left was altered from its original orange and white colors by exposure to alkaline soil which changed the orange to white and the white lines to a dark gray color. This is the same chemistry that is used to fuse the white lines into the stone beads, but occurring naturally over a long period of time. The necklace has a hand made clasp and beading tips made of Fine (999) silver.","$1,800.00","Agate, Chalcedony, Lapis Lazuli, Carnelian, Silver",,"The necklace is 23 3/8 inches (59 cm) in length.

The largest is 8.5 mm in length and 1 cm in width. The smallest is 3.5 mm in length and 4 mm in width. The diameters of the drill holes are 1.8 mm- 2 mm. The beads are slightly oblate; the beads are perceived to be round when strung on a cord together. This makes the strand look more solid. This feature of the beads has been utilized in the design of the necklace. Forty-six of the granulated silver beads have been made so that eight grains are arranged around an inner ring. This makes the spacer bead wider so that it perfectly fits in the space between the slightly shortened spheres. As the beads graduate to 5 mm it is unnecessary to use the inner ring and beads with six of the same size grains can be used to make the spacer beads. A silver clasp and beading tips completes the necklace. The beads are over two thousand years old.

To either side are two round agate beads, 6 mm in length, 8.5 mm in width with drill hold diameters of 1.8 mm. The beads have been affected by long exposure to alkaline soil which has caused some of the layers to take on an opaque white coloration in bands that were originally translucent. The necklace is designed to alternate agate and lapis beads and to alternate round beads with barrel shaped beads with a silver spacer bead between. This gives an alternating light and dark, long and short, regular pattern. As the the sizes of the beads decrease towards the back of the necklace, the round agates beads give way to agate barrel beads and the lapis beads become the short beads in the short/long alteration. These variations to the predictable pattern of the design are not immediately available to perception; the over all pattern appears to be unvarying.

M-22,M22,"A necklace of eighty-six carnelian beads alternating with eighty-three lapis lazuli beads strung in three cascading strands: the stone beads are all alternating with 20k gold granulated ring beads. There are two gold terminals into which the three strands, each 4 cm longer than the one above it, converge. The terminals are boxes with a rounded top and a square bottom which is bordered with three gold wires. On the bottom there are three round openings into which the strands are strung. These openings are encircled with a double stack of gold grains, the bottom one being slightly smaller than the upper. At the top of the box is affixed another gold bead at the perforation, this one is three layered with the center ring being larger than the two bordering it. The gold terminal facilitates the gathering of the three strands into one strand which then clasps behind the neck. The box is decorated with a round raised boss which is bordered by a gold wire with the same curvature as the top edge of the box. Inside the perimeter of the gold wire is a circular line of gold granules.
    The carnelian beads are of two shapes. The beads in the single strand that emerges from the top of the terminal are four sided with the opposing sides being triangles that align. The remaining two sides are also opposing triangles which  point in the opposite direction. If the beads are rotated ninety degrees around the axis of the drill hole, the isosceles triangles point in the opposite direction. The carnelian beads in the three strands are triangular in cross section, wider in the middle and tapering on the ends. The four sided beads are 4- 6 mm in length, 4.5 – 6 mm in width, the beads graduating in length to the shortest at the back of the necklace. The triangular cross section carnelian beads in the three strands are 1.1 cm in length at the center and graduate slightly in length towards the terminals where they are 8 mm in length. The carnelian beads are 3 -4 mm in width. The lapis lazuli beads are all round shapes which again graduate slightly in size towards the back of the necklace. The largest are 5 mm in length and the smallest are 3 mm. The beads are not true spheres: the width of the beads is slightly more than the length. This is perceived by the eye to be round.  The diameters of the drill holes of the stone beads is 1mm. The color of the lapis lazuli is a deep blue and the color of the carnelian is a very reddish orange which contrasts with the lapis to produce, when combined with the 20k gold, a very lavish appearance. The archaic form of the three cascading strands ending in gold terminals is the result of having a set of beads that match in shape and color that can be employed in this design.

The gold beads are 20k and made in an archaic style with raised ribs. The beading tips and clasp are also 20k gold and match the beads.
     The stone beads are all early Bronze Age. The carnelian bead on the left side at the back may be somewhat later, based on the smaller diameter drill hole. The large perforations,(over 3mm), and the bi conical shapes of the agate beads are all characteristics of beads produced by the Indus Valley civilization from 4,000 years ago. The center bead is very unusual because of the crescent shape. It is very similar to the flat lenticular beads from what is now Afghanistan from the same time period, except for the shape. The crescent shape seems very likely to symbolize the moon. This would be a Mesopotamian motif, associated with the goddess Ishtar. This necklace utilizes the barrel-shaped beads of the Indus civilization and the flat agate bead typical (except for its shape) of the contemporaneous civilization in what is now Afghanistan, to make a Mesopotamian moon amulet necklace. The ancient Sumerians did import beads from the Indus Valley as well as lapis lazuli and agate from Afghanistan. The beads have been carefully selected for their size, shape, color, and age and the gold beads have been custom made to harmonize with the stone beads.","$17,500.00","Agate, 20k gold",,"The necklace is 17 ½ inches (44.5 cm) in length,.

CRF-1,CRF1,"A necklace of twenty-three amethyst beads carved in the form of Crown flowers with five ridged lobes that flare on one end. There are four beveled triangular amethyst beads, two at the back of the necklace and two in the front on either side of the pendant bead. There are twenty-five 20k gold “stems” separating each of the flowers, and a granulated “crown” at the open end of each flower. A round bead at the apex of the necklace allows the largest of the amethyst flower beads to be strung as a pendant. A stack of three granulated gold ring beads of decreasing size with a granule of gold at the bottom acts as a stopper for the pendant bead. The beading tips are composted  of stacks of three granulated rings of decreasing size as well and they and the hook and eye clasps are also 20k gold. The pendant bead is missing a lobe and there is some minor damage to one of the other beads, but the complex form of the beads and the variegated color of the amethyst masks these slights imperfections. The Crown flower is native to Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. It grows as a large shrub to 4 m (13 feet) tall with clusters of waxy flowers that are either white or lavender. Each flower has five petals and a small “crown” rising from the center which holds the stamens. The flowers are long lasting and fragrant and are used in Thailand in floral arrangements and strung in garlands to ornament Buddha statures. In India the plant is common in the compounds of temples and is known as Madar in Hindi. It is used as an offering to the god Shiva. The milky white sap of the bush is toxic, making it an appropriate offering to Shiva who is able to ingest all poisons and transmute them into ambrosia. The sap has been used as an arrow poison and the bush is useful as a source of durable fiber. It is also known as Indian Bowstring bush. Its royal associations extend to Hawaii where it was favored by Queen Liliukalani, who considered them a symbol of royalty and wore them strung into leis. Until modern times, amethyst was very rare and expensive. Now there have been huge quantities discovered in Brazil, but in ancient times, the use of amethyst was reserved for only the very wealthy. It is very likely that this set of beads was commissioned by wealthy patrons, or perhaps even royalty, as a donation to a temple and intended to adorn a statue of Buddha. The beads were acquired in Chaing Mai in northern Thailand and were said to be Pyu period. It seems more likely that the beads are not from Myanmar, but are actually from Thailand and are somewhere around a thousand years old and not two thousand as they would be if they were Pyu. The problem with dating these beads is that there is nothing that we know of to compare them to; analysis of the technique of manufacturing the beads confirms that they are very old, but we have very little more information to guide us. The necklace is impressive in both size and technique. The complex forms of the flowers have been carefully reproduced. Both the color and the form makes the identification of the flower very certain. Other cultures, such as the ancient Egyptian, have made hard stone beads that mimic the forms of perishable flowers. The use of flowers as adornments goes back to the dawn of humanity and garlands of flowers have been used as offerings and worn in celebrations for thousands of years.","$25,000.00","Amethyst, 20k gold",,"The necklace is 23 ½ inches (59.7 cm) in length.

M-21,M21,"A necklace of twenty-two barrel shaped lapis lazuli beads and seventeen tabular shaped carnelian beads, the central bead being an etched carnelian “eye bead.” The eye bead is also face with two tiny carnelian beads with granulated 20k gold ring beads to either side. All the carnelian beads are faced with granulated ring beads of 20k gold and there is a hand made gold clasp and beading tips also made of 20k gold. The carnelian eye bead is oval shaped; the widest dimension is the width which is 1.35 cm. The length is 1.1 cm and the thickness is 4 mm at the center and 1.8 mm at the edges. The drill hole perforation is 2 mm. This appears to be an early period etched carnelian bead. The two indicators are the oval shape and white ring which has been artificially applied and the large size of the drill hole. Decorated carnelian and agate beads were first developed by the Indus Valley civilization over four thousand years ago. Artisans were brought to ancient Sumer from the Indus Valley to make the carnelian beads and to produce beads with white line patterns. The center bead has a circle on each side, artificially patterned by painting on an alkali solution and then heating over charcoal. In ancient times the alkali solution was made by burning certain desert plants and then mixing the ash with gum arabic derived from the acacia thorn bush to improve adhesion. The ash (potash) contains potassium and sodium carbonate which changes the chemical composition of the agate as it is heated. It acts very much like a flux and melts into and fuses with the surface. This eye bead is from the early period of production of ""etched"" (a misnomer that stuck) agates and carnelians in ancient India - of about four thousand years ago. The lapis beads are 5 mm in width and 3.5 mm in length. The groups of three beads have a longer barrel bead in the center faced by two shorter beads which are roughly one half the length. The tabular carnelian beads are 8 mm in diameter and 3 mm in thickness. The diameters of the drill holes are around 1 mm which indicates that these beads are not as ancient as the carnelian eye bead, probably around two thousand years old. The focal point of the necklace is the “eye” bead which was believed to have a magical power to protect the wearer from the “evil eye.” The primary purpose of the beads was to function as an amulet but beauty was also important as was the need to show wealth and social status. Although the lapis beads are very slightly irregular in shape, the alternating long-short-long arrangement and the regular placement of the carnelian beads gives a visual structure that when combined with the gold give a very rich impression. Dark blue lapis lazuli, deep orange carnelian and the luster of high carat gold were the three colors favored by the ancient Sumerians for their ornaments.

Except for the two lighter green beads, all the beads are of a blue green color that seems to be only found in Costa Rica. Artifacts made from this jade were first found in Olmec sites in Mexico. It is now speculated that they must have been imported from Costa Rica but this has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. The relationship of the ancient people of Costa Rica to the Olmec is still obscure. There are Olmec features to the pendant which depicts a squat figure with arms folded in front of the chest with a wide mouth with a protruding tongue and a triangular nose. The “X” (on the tongue that extends to the chest) is found on Olmec figures as is the clef on the top of the head. Both of these signify elite or kingly authority. On this figure there are two profile crocodile heads facing outward on either side of the clef which is not an Olmec motif. The extended tongue is a Costa Rican convention and other examples have cross hatching, chevron, herringbone or guilloche-patterned incising. The jadite has been cord sawn from a pebble and details have been achieved by drilling with drills with siliceous stone tips. The back of this pendant has a line that is the result of cord sawing with plant fibers and abrasives, or perhaps strips of animal skin, held taut by a curved piece of wood. Later the stone is worked against sandstone, or other stones combined with water and abrasives such as ground quartz. Finally the piece is polished.
   In Costa Rica, from about 300 B.C. until A.D. 500-700, a vigorous, prolific and distinctive tradition of jade carving flourished. It was stimulated by the Mesoamerican (Olmec) tradition of figural carving and reverence for the green color of jade which had great symbolic importance. But Costa Rica, which is mostly covered by tropical rain forest was never part of Mesoamerica, nor did Mesoamerican people reside there apart from sporadic trade missions. These people were a culture unto themselves and the dynamics and stimuli for their achievements, by way of contacts with other peoples, is yet to be completely understood.","$14,000.00","Jade, 20k gold",,"The necklace is 20 inches (50.8 cm) in length.

CRJ-2,CRJ2,"A necklace of  of ten barrel shaped beads and seventy-two disc beads of green stone and jade from ancient Costa Rica with a celt form “a-god effigy”pendant made from a green granite stone. The pendant 9.8 cm in height, 8.5mm in thickness and 3.4 cm in width at the bottom. At the top it is 2.13cm in width. The Costa Rican pendant form is that of an elaborated celt. On the smaller end of the ax, where it would have been hafted, are stylized depictions of human beings, animals, birds or combinations of these. The celt form is considered to take its meaning from its value as a tool necessary for survival among stone age societies. Time consuming and difficult to make, the possession of a fine ax conferred status and this in time became a badge of that status, a pendant designed to be suspended and worn on the body. This pendant depicts a human figure with the arms folded across the chest. The figure is stylized with grooves that indicate the chin, mouth, eyes and a triangular nose. The figure wears a headband with diagonal hatching and a hat or headpiece with a central clef. Facing outward from this clef are two profile heads of crocodiles (or possibly eagles), the eyes indicated by drilled dots and a groove indicating the mouth. The face is formal and serene. It may portray an elite authority figure “sitting in office.” We know the Mayans used the symbolism of sitting to mean ruling and the depiction of the seating mat was a symbol of power. The material is not jade and appears to be granite mottled with dark green, light green and greenish white with tiny flecks of mica. Like jade, granite is a very hard stone and as with jade, the green color has great symbolic importance.","$7,500.00","Jade, Granite, 20k gold",,"The necklace is 19 1/8 inch (48.6 cm) in length.

C-1,C1,"A short necklace featuring a gold capped long carnelian barrel bead strung with two hundred fifty granulated gold ring beads. Two small carnelian beads face the gold capped center bead; there are two smaller gold capped carnelian barrel beads at the back of the necklace. Gold beading tips and a hook and eye clasp complete the necklace. The gold capped center bead is 6.8 cm in length and 8.1 mm in diameter at the center of the bead. The drill hole diameter is 3.5 mm. The caps are 1.7cm in length and 7.2 mm in diameter. The two small carnelian beads that face the center capped bead are 4.25 mm in diameter and 2 mm in length. The granulated ring beads are 3.8 mm – 3.5 mm in diameter graduating to smaller size to the back of the necklace. The capped carnelian beads at the back of the necklace are 1.82 mm and 1.9 mm in length. The carnelian beads are 3.8 mm in diameter. The diameter of the drill holes is 1.8 mm. There are two larger granulated ring beads between each of the capped carnelians and the beading tips, both two layers of six grains. These are 5 mm in diameter. There are two single layer beads of this size facing the small carnelian beads next to the ends of the gold caps of the center bead. The beading tips are cylinders with one open end, the other pierced for the string to pass through, the knots being hidden within the cylinders. Circlets of wire attach to the sides of these cylinders and pass over the open end and provide the attachments points for the hook and eye clasp. The gold is all 20k. 
    The center bead is a long barrel carnelian tube bead from the Indus Valley, located in present day Pakistan and India. The constricted cylinder drills that made it possible to drill such long holes, and bead making debris have been found at the workshop city of Chanhudaro in the Indus Valley. There is also evidence of production of these beads at two great urban centers, Mohenjodaro and Harappa. They may have only been made between 2450 to 1900 BC at Chanhudaro, a period of just a few hundred years. Constricted cylinder drills were less likely to seize up during the drilling of the hole, but often the holes were stepped to smaller sizes as they progressed, sometimes leaving three channels within the bead, each smaller than the last and then stepping up to a larger size (or sizes) from the center out to the end of the bead. Unfortunately, pushing this technology to the limit resulted in very thin walls at the ends of the beads which are often chipped. Gold caps both protect the ends and hide damage as is the case with this bead. Although one end was broken, large caps have restored the beauty of this ancient masterpiece of lapidary work. When illuminated from behind, the layers in the carnelian are clearly visible. A small amount whitening from long exposure to alkaline soil is visible on one end of the bead. It has only affected the layers in the banding which are presumably less dense or more porous and can absorb water. There are two hundred fifty gold ring beads in the necklace. These are made up of six granules which have been fused together by means of the granulation process. This technique, used in the ancient world, allows high carat gold (and silver) to be fused without the use of solder. Very fine detailed work can be accomplished by this means, which would not be possible by other techniques of joining. When small pieces of gold wire are heated to a molten state, the surface tension of the liquid metal automatically produces a spherical shape. One thousand five hundred such granules went into the making of this necklace.","$14,000.00","Carnelian, 20k gold",,"The necklace is 17 13/16 inches (45.3 cm) in length.

The beads are 7.8 mm and 8 mm in diameter at the center and have drill holes of 3mm. The end widths are 5 mm. The over all lengths with the caps are 2.9 cm and the cap ends have a diameter of 7 mm. The third set of agate beads are quartz with carnelian banding. They are 1.9 cm in length, 6.8 mm and 7 mm wide at the center and 6 mm and 6.3 mm wide at the ends. The hole diameters are 3 mm. The overall lengths with the caps are 2.9 cm and the cap ends have a diameter of 7.2 mm.

The two cylinder beads at the back of the necklace are probably two thousand years old as is the center jasper bead. All the other agate barrel beads are four thousand years old. The shapes are right for this period but the large drill holes of 3 mm and larger are a sure indication. Drill hole diameters of 2 mm are usually about two thousand years old if the shapes of the beads are typical of that era as well. The six sided carnelian beads may also be from this middle period but they may later. When diamond drills were used the drill holes were typically much smaller.

The necklace is completed by gold beading tips and a hook and eye clasp. The seven carnelian tube beads that make up this necklace are from the Indus Valley, located in present day Pakistan and India. The beads are remarkably consistent in size and shape; matching sets of these beads are rare. The constricted cylinder drills that made it possible to drill such long holes, and bead making debris have been found at the workshop city of Chanhudaro in the Indus Valley. There is also evidence of production of these beads at two great urban centers, Mohenjodaro and Harappa.

These beads appear to be drilled from each end with the two holes meeting in the center. The beads are unusual in several regards. The form is slightly different from the typical long Indus carnelian tube beads. They are slightly shorter and the proportions are more exaggerated. The width in the center is proportionally thicker; the centers almost appear to bulge. The bead caps taper in at the ends to a smaller diameter than the ends of the beads which accentuates the effect.

The diameter of the drill hole is 2 mm. The bead is slightly domed on the front side. This has left the top sides of the drill hole thin and vulnerable to chipping, which has occurred. We have remedied this problem by inserting gold tubes inside the drill hole. This both protects the bead and allows it to hang properly. The two tabular carnelian beads to either side of the center bead are 7.25 mm in length and width. They are 3 mm in thickness and have drill hole diameters of 1 mm. The pair of tabular carnelian beads at the back of the necklace are slightly smaller: length 6.5 mm, thickness  2.7 mm - 3.2 mm. The granulated ring beads are 2.8 mm in diameter. A pair of beading tips and a hook and eye clasp complete the necklace. The beading tips are cylinders with one open end, the other end with a hole for the string to pass through. The knots are hidden inside the cylinders. At the open end are two circlets of gold wire which attach to the sides of the cylinders. These provide the attachment loops for the hook and eye clasp. The gold is 20k. The granulation process used to make the 250 ring beads is ancient. The technique was lost and had to be rediscovered in modern times. It is a way to fuse high carat gold (and silver) without the use of solder. However, it requires time and patience. Fifteen hundred individual grains had to be made and then fused in hexagonal rings to produce this necklace. The focal point of the necklace is the spectacular eye bead. The agate is layered with six colors: translucent quartz, light brown, dark brown, white, yellow, orange and dark brown. By doming the front side, each of these layers in revealed as a concentric circle, thereby forming the “eye.” This eye was believed to have the magical power of protecting the wearer from harm, specifically, the “evil eye,” or a curse from an adversary. It has the function of bedazzling the malefactor's eye, of compelling the gaze of the adversary to go to the eye bead and thereby deflecting the harm. This very widespread belief still persists to this day in the Near East and in Central Asia. Perhaps it is because we are preconditioned, as infants, to seek out our mother's eyes, that we automatically are drawn to the pattern of the concentric circles. 
        A back view of the tabular eye bead clearly shows the drill hole with the inserted gold tubes. The dark brown and white layers were removed in the drill channel leaving the translucent quartz layer intact. The back side of the bead is as handsome and interesting as the front side. It is unusual to have the orange color along with the dark brown or black, brown and white colors that are typically seen in this kind of bead. The bead is striking and dramatic in its visual impact.","$14,000.00","Carnelian, Agate, 20k gold",,"The necklace is 16 5/8 inches (42.3 cm) in length.

A pair of gold beading tips and a hook and eye clasp complete the necklace. The gold is 20k. The etching of agate and carnelian beads is accomplished by painting onto the surface of the bead as alkali (potash, white lead, and washing soda have all been reportedly used), and then subsequently firing the bead. This permanently whitens the area of the bead covered with the alkali. The whitening is not merely a glazing of the surface. The surface is often unaffected by this process; the whitening actually occurs beneath the surface and extends downward into the stone. The whitened areas may be raised on some specimen; in a few cases, the designs are sunken into the stone, the solution having acted like a flux as it was absorbed into the surface and melted the structure of the agate or carnelian. Etched beads have been manufactured since very early times. Beck attributed the specimens known to him to three main periods: Early (before 2000 BC), Middle (300 BC to 200 AD), and Late (600 to 1000 AD). Francis has expanded and revised this dating as follows: Early (2700 BC to 1800 BC), Middle (550 BC to 200 AD), and Late (224 to 642 AD). Etched beads from the earliest period have been found mainly at Mesopotamian and Indus civilization sites.

Francis makes a strong case that the centers of manufacture of Late period etched beads was Iran and dates them to Sassanian times (224 to 642 AD).
     Most of the beads in this necklace appear to be from the Middle period, but there are a few that are Early. Three beads are unusual: The center bead, a tapered barrel shape, has five white lines that are at the bottom of five grooves that have been shaped around the outside, down the length of the bead. These troughs have been rounded so that the bead appears to swell around the constrictions of the white lines. Two other beads have black lines instead of white and a whitened background. Beck devised a classification system calling white lines on a natural background “Type I” and those that are first whitened and then have black lines put on them “Type II.” Exposure to alkaline soil over a period of time will also whiten the surface, and it seems that this process, essentially the same chemistry as artificially whitening, will also turn the white line dark. (It is now an open question whether or not these “Type II” beads were deliberately and intentionally produced or if they are merely the result of accidental processes).","$10,300.00","Carnelian, 20k gold",,"The necklace is 20 5/8 inches (52.4 cm) in length.

The shapes are oval rather than circular, with a raised rib in the center. Two thin sheets of gold have been joined so that these ribs match up and become the channel through which the bead is strung. The clasp and beading tips are also handmade from 20k gold. The carnelian beads are strung in groups of three with the “winged disc” gold beads separating the groups. The gold beads are made to be just slightly larger in width than the carnelian beads to each side. The squared off shapes of the carnelian beads, with their right angle corners, contrasts with the oval gold beads, so that the impression is of circles and squares alternating. There is some whitening of the surface of some of the beads, the result of chemical interaction with the alkaline soil in which the beads were buried. The beads come from the Swat Valley of what is now northern Pakistan. They are probably around two thousand years old.
     The necklace is light in weight and delicate, resulting from the flattened shapes of the beads which eliminates about two-thirds of the mass of a similar bead that is round in cross section.

The tabular gold beads are made by joining together two thin flat oval sheets with a raised ridge running down the middle so that the ridges line up forming a hollow channel through which the bead may be strung. This “winged disc” bead was developed during the archaic period over four and one half thousand years ago. The two gold sheets were fused together without the use of  soft solder, using the same technique employed in the use of decorative granulation.

SCL-12,SCL12,"A necklace of forty-eight barrel shaped gneiss beads from which is suspended a granite coyote. The coyote is 12 cm in length, 3 cm in height and  3.7 cm wide at the hips. The bottom has been hollowed out to reduce the weight of the object and two holes penetrate the the top. These holes are 1 cm in diameter at the top surface but become smaller as they go; they meet a similar set of holes which are drilled from the bottom side. The barrel shaped gneiss beads graduate in size from the from to the back of the necklace. The largest of these is 2.15 cm in length, 1.12 cm wide at the center of the bead and 6.5 mm wide at the ends. The drill hole diameter is 2.5 mm. The smallest of these beads is 1 cm in length, 5.9 mm wide at the center and 3 mm wide at the ends. The drill hole diameter is 2.3 mm. The coyote is somewhat large to be comfortably worn and yet the two holes drilled through the back indicate that it was meant to be suspended, presumably from a necklace. Perhaps it was used solely in a ritual context. The coyote form is similar to Colima pottery found in western Mexico. The coyote motif and the style are MesoAmerican, but it is uncertain if this is from Colima. The beads are a metamorphosed granite, or gneiss, and come from sub Saharan Africa. Gneiss beads that are very old have been found in Mali and they were made and worn for thousands of years up until present times. Both the pendant and the beads could easily be a thousand years old, but we are only able to date them very approximately.","$1,300.00","Gneiss, (Granite)",,"The necklace is 27 inches (68.6 cm) in length.

Most of the coral beads are similarly sized, around 1 cm in length (one is 1.4 cm in length), and 1 cm in width. The turquoise beads are 2.5 cm to 3.3 cm in length, 2.5 cm – 2 cm in width and about 1.5 cm in thickness. Necklaces of coral and turquoise (and amber) have been called “Tibetan” style, but this combination of stones (which frequently also includes ancient agate beads such as dZi beads) was and is still worn throughout the Himalayan region, including northern Nepal, Bhutan, Sikim, Ladakh, and Tibet. The color of the stones are symbolic but the actual substances of the stones are also thought to have a curative and amuletic power. For instance, turquoise is thought to be good for the liver, coral is good for the blood and so forth. Amber has been held in high regard since the earliest times; “tears of the sun” was one mytho-poetic description. One special characteristic of amber is that when rubbed with woolen cloth, it can hold a charge of static electricity. With this one can cause small lint and dust particles to seemingly by “magic”, jump onto the amber. It also has a wonderful fragrance of pine; amber is a fossilized prehistoric tree resin. Most of the world's amber has come from the Baltic sea and made its way by trade even to the remote Himalayan region.

Worn as an amulet of protection as well as a badge of cultural identity, coral and turquoise necklaces are an essential element of the Himalayan woman's daily costume. Coral and turquoise beads may also be worn by men and not just as beads on a string around the neck, but also as hair ornaments and earrings. It is believed that the wearing of these stones makes the body more resilient and less susceptible to disease.
